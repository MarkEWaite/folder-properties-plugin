<body>
    Make all of these properties available to the jobs contained within this folder or its sub-folders.
    <br>
    In structures where two or more folders are nested, any property defined for a folder will be overridden by any
    other property of the same name defined by one of its sub-folders.
    <br>
    Freestyle jobs must opt into inheriting these properties by selecting the <em>Folder Properties</em> build wrapper
    from the <em>Build Environment</em> section of their configuration page.
    <br>
    Pipeline jobs can use step <em>withFolderProperties</em> to access them.
